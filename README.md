# Student-Blockchain
<p> This idea was created using Java EE and by creating a local server on the my computert using <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/"> Tomcat </a> server. The main idea of the purposed idea, was to create a way for a person who ownered the blockchain to share the whole blockchain to a person who they wanted to view it as a portfolio of records. At the moment the code itself can search blockchain that are entered from a paraticular blockchain website and return the hashes that the code finds in there records. the hashes that are returned in the code, represent idea that explained further in my "whitepaper" that these returned hashes are issued records from universities to the student at the time of attending the university. </p>
