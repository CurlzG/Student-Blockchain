# Student-Blockchain
<p> This idea was created using Java EE and by creating a local server on the my computert using <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/"> Tomcat </a> server. The main idea of the purposed idea, was to create a way for a person who ownered the blockchain to share the whole blockchain to a person who they wanted to view it as a portfolio of records. <br> </p>

<p>In this example above, we can from another whitepaper that is reference in the my white paper, what the purposed student blockchain could do, with taking the next step an updating a database records at universities and letting students be able to keep a permanent veritified record on them whereever they go.</p><br> <br> <p>At the moment the code itself can search blockchain that are entered from a paraticular blockchain website and return the hashes that the code finds in there records. the hashes that are returned in the code, represent idea that explained further in my "whitepaper" that these returned hashes are issued records from universities to the student at the time of attending the university. </p> <br>

<p>In this example above, you can see what the purposed records page looks like when the application is ran on the local server </p>

<h1> Note to any developers looking at my code </h1>
<p> I have not made my code good, it is fununctional but it doesn't have any exceptions or anything else and there is alot of issues that i will have to fix. if you decide to test run it, you the buttons on the homepage at the moment dont work, you have to select the blockchain and enter it into the text box and press enter then the page will load. </p>
